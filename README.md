## Description
- Motivation: My motivation in making this was to learn how to create progressive web apps.
- Why: I built this application to learn how to create an installable application that works in offline mode.
- What problem does this solve: This solves the problem of wanting to save updates without an internet connection
- What I learned: I learned a lot about how to put together a webpack config and how to utilize service workers.
- Challanges: This project was a great lesson in how finnicky setting up config is.  I ran into several issues that were just typos but fully halted progress for a while.
